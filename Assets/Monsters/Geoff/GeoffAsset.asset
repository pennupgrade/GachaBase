  description: "Team Name: AmongEYE\n\nDescription: Collect enough coins to help
    Geoff grow big and strong! Simply click on Geoff to make him generate coins.
    Raising Geoff is a tough task, but with your help, he can really\u2026 come out
    of his shell.\n\nBackstory: Geoff is a perfectly normal critter, but he has big
    dreams. The design was originally based on Kha\u2019zix from League of Legends,
    but eventually it became Pok\xE9mon and Hollow Knight inspired."
