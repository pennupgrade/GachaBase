  description: 'Description: Spront is a one man football team looking to score some
    coins, but his team forgot there was a game today! It''s gonna be all on him
    to make it work. Use the space bar to snap the ball and then use the WASD keys
    to run a route and shake your defenders. When you''re open, press space to have
    the QB throw the ball, then catch it and run as far as you can without being
    tackled. Watch out for interceptions!'
